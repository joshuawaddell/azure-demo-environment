# Azure Demo Environment

The Azure Demo Environment, aka ADE, is a series of PowerShell Scripts, CLI
Script, and ARM Templates that automatically generates an environment of Azure
Resources and Services to an Azure Subscription. While not every Azure Service
is deployed as a part of ADE, it does showcase many of the common, and more
often complex, scenarios withing Azure, and it can be used as an example when
designing a solution. The Azure Demo Environment is built to be deployed,
deallocated, allocated, removed and re-deployed. The deployment and removal
processes take approximate two hours. Instructions are provided below. The Azure
Demo Environment is an Open Source Project. Contributions are welcome and
encouraged!
